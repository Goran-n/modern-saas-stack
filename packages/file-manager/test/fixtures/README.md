# Test Fixtures

This directory contains test fixtures for the file-manager package tests.

## PDF Invoice Files

The PDF invoice files have been removed from version control to reduce repository size. 

To run tests that require these files:

1. Download the test PDFs from the shared storage location (ask team for access)
2. Place them in the `invoices/` directory
3. Run the tests as normal

Expected files:
- adobe_subscription.pdf
- airdna_invoice.pdf
- chatgpt_invoice.pdf
- figma_invoice.pdf
- microsoft_invoice.pdf
- notion_invoice.pdf
- xero_monthly.pdf
- zoom_invoice.pdf

Note: These files are listed in .gitignore and should not be committed to the repository.
