# tRPC Migration Summary

## What Was Done

Successfully migrated the tRPC setup from `packages/trpc` to the proper monorepo structure:

### 1. Created `apps/api` - The API Server Application
- **Location**: `/apps/api`
- **Purpose**: The deployable API server that runs the tRPC endpoints
- **Contains**:
  - `src/index.ts` - Entry point that bootstraps and starts the server
  - `src/server.ts` - Hono server setup with tRPC integration
  - Full application configuration and dependencies

### 2. Restructured `packages/trpc` - Shared tRPC Package
- **Location**: `/packages/trpc`
- **Purpose**: Shared library containing tRPC routers, procedures, and types
- **Contains**:
  - Router definitions (files router)
  - Procedure definitions (public, protected, tenant)
  - Context creation
  - Authentication middleware
  - Type exports for client usage

### 3. Key Changes Made

#### Structure Changes:
- Moved server-specific code (`server.ts`, `example-server.ts`) to `apps/api`
- Kept shared tRPC definitions in `packages/trpc`
- Updated imports to use the package structure
- Fixed TypeScript configurations for both locations

#### Package Configuration:
- `apps/api` is marked as private and includes runtime dependencies
- `packages/trpc` exports types and routers for use by the API and future clients
- Both packages have proper build and typecheck scripts

### 4. Benefits of This Structure

1. **Separation of Concerns**: 
   - The API app handles server runtime concerns
   - The tRPC package provides reusable definitions

2. **Type Safety**: 
   - Client applications can import types from `@kibly/trpc`
   - End-to-end type safety is maintained

3. **Scalability**:
   - Easy to add more routers to the tRPC package
   - Can create multiple API servers if needed
   - Client apps can be type-safe without depending on server code

4. **Standard Monorepo Pattern**:
   - Apps are deployable units
   - Packages are shared libraries
   - Clear boundaries and dependencies

## Usage

### Running the API Server:
```bash
cd apps/api
bun run dev  # Development with hot reload
bun run start  # Production
```

### Using tRPC Types in Client:
```typescript
import type { AppRouter } from "@kibly/trpc";
import { createTRPCProxyClient } from "@trpc/client";

const client = createTRPCProxyClient<AppRouter>({
  // ... configuration
});
```

## TypeScript Configuration

Both packages now have proper TypeScript configurations that work with the monorepo structure. The `bun typecheck` command passes successfully in both locations.
