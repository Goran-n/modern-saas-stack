Remove any references to standalone server functionality or server.ts files. The package should provide webhook handler functions, request verification middleware, and message processing utilities as exportable modules. Structure the exports to allow the main API to selectively import and mount only the needed functionality on its routes.\n</info added on 2025-07-18T16:56:25.874Z>\n<info added on 2025-07-18T17:00:02.000Z>\nThe communication package should operate as a pure business logic layer without any web framework concerns. All middleware functionality (request signature verification, rate limiting, CORS) should be removed from this package as they belong in the API server layer. The package's responsibility is strictly limited to: parsing incoming message payloads from WhatsApp and Slack webhooks, extracting and validating message content and attachments, uploading files to the file-manager service using its client interface, constructing job payloads for document processing, and triggering jobs through the existing job queue infrastructure. This separation ensures the communication package remains focused on message processing logic while the API server handles all HTTP-specific concerns like authentication, rate limiting, and request validation.\n</info added on 2025-07-18T17:00:02.000Z>",
