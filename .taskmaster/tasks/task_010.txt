# Task ID: 10
# Title: Production Deployment and Monitoring Setup
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8, 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Configure production infrastructure, monitoring, alerting, and implement gradual rollout strategy
# Details:
Set up production Twilio configuration with dedicated phone number and approved message templates. Configure Slack app for production with public distribution. Implement Blue-Green deployment strategy using environment variables for gradual rollout (25%, 50%, 100%). Set up DataDog APM for distributed tracing across services. Configure PagerDuty alerts for webhook failures, high error rates, job queue backlog. Implement custom CloudWatch metrics for business KPIs. Create Grafana dashboards for real-time monitoring. Set up log aggregation with proper indexing in CloudWatch Logs. Implement feature flags using LaunchDarkly for controlled rollout. Create runbooks for common operational tasks. Set up automated backups for communication data. Configure auto-scaling for webhook endpoints based on request rate. Implement canary deployments with automatic rollback on error threshold. Create comprehensive documentation including API docs, troubleshooting guide, and admin manual.

# Test Strategy:
Load test production endpoints with expected traffic. Test monitoring alerts with simulated failures. Verify rollback procedures. Test backup and restore processes. Chaos engineering tests for resilience. Performance baseline testing. Test feature flag controls. Validate runbook procedures with team.
