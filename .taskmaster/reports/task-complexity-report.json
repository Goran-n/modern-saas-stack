			"taskId": 1,
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 12,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the communication service foundation into subtasks including: project setup with TypeScript and Hono configuration, webhook endpoint implementation for each platform, signature verification middleware creation, rate limiting setup, logging infrastructure, error handling and global middleware, abstract interfaces design, health monitoring endpoints, request validation schemas, CORS configuration, documentation setup, and initial testing framework",
			"reasoning": "This is a foundational task requiring multiple complex components including cryptographic security, rate limiting, structured logging, and abstract architecture design. Each component requires careful implementation and testing, justifying 12 subtasks to ensure proper separation of concerns and maintainability."

		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 10,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide database implementation into: initial Supabase setup and Drizzle configuration, creation of each table with proper schemas, RLS policy implementation for multi-tenancy, index optimization setup, trigger creation for timestamps, soft delete implementation, encrypted field setup with pgcrypto, database functions for verification logic, automated cleanup job configuration, and migration testing suite",
			"reasoning": "Database schema requires careful design with security considerations (RLS, encryption), performance optimization (indexes), and data integrity (constraints, triggers). The multi-tenant architecture and encryption requirements add complexity, warranting 10 subtasks for thorough implementation."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 11,
			"expansionPrompt": "Structure Twilio integration into: SDK installation and service class setup, webhook configuration with ngrok, phone number validation implementation, verification code generation system, message handler implementation for different types, PDF validation and size checking, environment configuration with Doppler, retry logic with exponential backoff, webhook signature validation, message template creation, and rate limit handling",
			"reasoning": "Twilio integration involves multiple API interactions, security considerations, file handling, and robust error management. The verification flow and various message types require separate focused implementations, justifying 11 subtasks."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 12,
			"expansionPrompt": "Organize Slack integration into: Slack app manifest creation and configuration, OAuth2 flow implementation with security, token encryption system setup, Socket Mode and Events API configuration, event handler implementation for files, channel listing and selection API, user mapping logic, file download streaming implementation, rate limit handling, workspace data caching with Redis, graceful disconnection flow, and comprehensive error handling",
			"reasoning": "Slack integration is complex due to OAuth2 security requirements, multiple API interactions, event-driven architecture, and the need for both development and production configurations. Token encryption and user mapping add additional complexity layers."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 9,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down frontend components into: base component setup with Nuxt 3 composition API, phone input integration with country selector, OTP input component with auto-focus, countdown timer implementation, Pinia store for state management, validation setup with VeeValidate, notification system integration, resend functionality with cooldown, and accessibility/responsive design implementation",
			"reasoning": "While frontend development is straightforward, the verification flow requires multiple interactive components, state management, and user experience considerations. The international phone input and accessibility requirements add moderate complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Structure Slack frontend into: OAuth button component with Slack guidelines, redirect handler middleware, channel selector with search functionality, connection status display component, disconnection flow with confirmation, API integration with error handling, connection management table, and activity indicator implementation",
			"reasoning": "Slack connection UI involves OAuth flow handling, dynamic data display, and multiple user interactions. The multi-workspace support and activity tracking add complexity, but overall implementation is moderate compared to backend tasks."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 13,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide message processing into: base MessageProcessor class design, platform abstraction layer, file streaming upload implementation, user ID mapping system, unified file validation, audit logging infrastructure, job queue integration, command message handling, backpressure implementation, metrics collection setup with OpenTelemetry, circuit breaker pattern implementation, idempotency mechanism, and comprehensive error handling",
			"reasoning": "This is the most complex task as it requires integrating multiple platforms, handling various edge cases, implementing resilience patterns, and ensuring reliable message processing. The need for monitoring, circuit breakers, and idempotency significantly increases complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 11,
			"expansionPrompt": "Organize dashboard into: main dashboard page with tab navigation, Chart.js integration for statistics, real-time updates with Supabase, communication logs table implementation, filtering and search functionality, export feature for multiple formats, integration health monitoring, cost tracking component, webhook status indicators, alert configuration UI, and log retention management",
			"reasoning": "The dashboard requires multiple data visualizations, real-time updates, complex filtering, and various administrative features. The integration of multiple data sources and export functionality adds significant complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 14,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down security implementation into: webhook signature verification for both platforms, request size limiting, IP allowlisting middleware, GDPR export functionality, data retention policy implementation, phone number hashing system, abuse detection with Redis, security headers middleware, API key rotation mechanism, PII detection in logs, compliance report generation, AWS KMS integration, zero-trust verification implementation, and security testing suite",
			"reasoning": "Security hardening is highly complex due to multiple security layers, compliance requirements, cryptographic implementations, and the need for comprehensive testing. Each security measure requires careful implementation to avoid vulnerabilities."
